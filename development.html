  <!-- Context and Audience -->
  <div>
    <h2>Understanding Context and Audience</h2>
    <p> The atlas is intended for an audience of people hiking Costa Rica’s network of trails.
      In its early stages of development, the project will be limited to a certain audience by
      the technology and language used. With continued development the project is intended to
      serve the complete audience of users for Costa Rica’s trail networks.
    </p>
    <p>In order to serve the intended community in the best way possible, it was decided that
      the initial atlas product would be developed primarily for a spanish speaking community.
      Trail users are presently predominantly spanish speaking and as such, this app will serve
      them well. This choice of language also serves the local spanish speaking communities along
      the trails. The use of spanish in early product development allows local community members
      to easily engage with the project, understand, and contribute. We hope this relationship
      will remain strong as the Atlas is adapted to alternative languages in future development.
    </p>
    <p>Though the atlas is intended for a wider audience of the Costa Rican hiking community, the
      project’s initial contact with this audience to the form the La Alianza for el Sendero
      Pacifico (The Alliance for the Pacific Trail) and Los Senderos de Costa Rica (The Trails
      of Costa Rica). These are informal alliances of community members, businesses, and organizations
      directed at supporting their regional or national trail networks. This audience contributed
      valuable data, testing, and feedback during this current phase of development. Both groups
      have expressed interest in continuing their involvement in the project. This collaboration
      is critical to the project’s success as it allows local stakeholders to directly participate
      in its development.
    </p>

  <!-- Project Initiation -->
  <div>
    <h2>Project Initiation</h2>
    <p>Prior to this project, starting in 2017 the WTN Hub for the Americas, in conjunction with
      La Alianza por el Sendero Pacifico, has engaged students from various Universities including
      Yale, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and Middlebury College in work related to geographic
      information products related to the region surround El Sendero Pacifico. These efforts resulted
      in valuable data that has been used to study regional conservation efforts and develop maps to
      support regional trail based recreation. Related work had been completed at the Monteverde
      Institute starting as early as 2004. This project is a continuation of these efforts to support
      the area with actionable geographic information.
    </p>
    <p>The collaboration between Clark University and the World Trails Network arose from a chance
      meeting between mutual friends in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. An initial discussion
      revealed the desire for, among other products, an online map detailing the trail network of El
      Sendero Pacifico, which would include digital media such as pictures, video, and web links,
      along with details of the trails and adjacent communities. This product had the potential to
      be coupled with a parallel project being developed by students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
      This parallel project was focused on supporting businesses in the trail-adjacent communities in a
      move to e-commerce, in order to expand their reach regionally and potentially internationally.
      Following this introduction and discussion of concepts, a brief onboarding period ensued during
      which a formal working relationship was formed and resources including data and collaboration
      platforms were shared.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Data Development -->
  <div>
    <h2>Data Development</h2>
    <p>Prior to developing the desired cartographic applications, the underlying data that would describe
      the trail network needed to be developed. That this data already existed to a great extent was a
      great boon to the pace of the project. An earlier project that the World Trails Network had been
      engaged in with students from Worcester State, had developed a database containing a wide range
      of vector data related to local administration, utilities, natural features, and trail networks.
      The data most pertinent to the project, the trail networks, was collected by students and community
      members in years prior to the start of this project. Additional geographic data regarding the trails
      were collected from publicly available sources including <a href=”https://www.wikiloc.com/>Wikiloc</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The existing trail data was available in mixed forms including both raw field data and carefully
      edited data, but in all cases were not entirely complete. These data were aggregated and edited
      in ArcGIS pro. Preparing these data for editing and later use included the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>converting data to Esri’s proprietary Shapefile format,</li>
      <li>converting raw ordered points from GPS data to lines,</li>
      <li>simplifying line geometry to remove repeated segments, artefacts of gps inaccuracy, and non-trail
         segments,</li>
      <li>merging and splitting lines to produce logical segments between trail intersections, and</li>
      <li>calculating line segment lengths.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Following this primary editing stage a more collaborative process began between the student and
      stakeholders familiar with the trails. This process spanned a number of weeks and involved
      interactive sessions held over video conference where information regarding trail surface type,
      recommended mode of travel, access restrictions, colloquial names, and other details were added
      to the map.
    </p>

    <p>Additional contextual data was added alongside the trail data throughout development. This data
      includes communities along El Sendero Pacifico, local high points, important reference points
      along the trail, attractions and dangers along the trail, and relevant commercial establishments.
      Much of this contextual data was produced by the past work of students and communities, mentioned
      earlier, or in the collaborative process described above. In the case of information related to
      products available in each community along El Sendero Pacifico, the data were collected in a
      process led by WPI students in parallel to this project. Their process involved informational
      interviews held over video conference with businesses and community members in the immediate
      vicinity of El Sendero Pacifico.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond geographic data and their attributes, related visual and electronic media were gathered
      to provide a more engaging experience for atlas users. These media include photos embedded in
      informational popups attached to trails, communities, and other locations. These also include
      hyperlinks to other resources online and embedded videos, currently hosted on youtube, that had
      been produced by a previous project driven by La Alianza por el Sendero Pacifico.
    </p>

  <!-- Interface Development -->
  <div>
    <h2>Interface Development</h2>
    <p>In its present state, the atlas is implemented in
      <a href=”https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-web-appbuilder/overview”>
        Esri’s ArcGIS Web AppBuilder</a>. This powerful web
      mapping tool allowed for rapid, low-code development and a simple transition of data from desktop
      editing software (<a href=”https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro”>Esri’s ArcGIS
      Pro</a>) to a publicly accessible interface. Prior to the present interface, a number of
      prototypes were developed using a range of programmable graphical libraries. These prototypes
      used services including <a href=”https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs”>Mapbox GL JS</a>,
      <a href=”https://leafletjs.com/”>Leaflet</a>, and <a href=”https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/”>
        ArcGIS API for Javascript</a>. These intermediary product served as both
      demonstrations of the services and means of reviewing the data that had been developed. Based
      on observations during the interface development phase, the trail and ancillary data were
      continuously updated to correct any mistakes or add new data.
    </p>
    <p><a href=”https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-web-appbuilder/overview”> Esri’s
      ArcGIS Web AppBuilder</a> was ultimately chosen for full interface development due to it’s
      ease of use, wide range of functionality, and interoperability with the data editing platform
      used in data development. Transitioning from the data development process to interface development
      was a simple and smooth process enabled by Portal for ArcGIS Pro. This tool in ArcGIS Pro allows
      for quick data migration between the desktop software and ArcGIS Online. Once uploaded to ArcGIS
      Online, the data can be displayed, styled,and modified using a wide range of online tools. If
      changes are made to the data using desktop applications, the updated data can be easily uploaded
      to ArcGIS Online, either overwriting the existing files or creating ones. This easy interoperability
      was key to making it easy to manage the parallel data editing and interface development phases.
    </p>
    <p>With the trail and ancillary data uploaded to ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Map Viewer Classic was used to
      display and style these in a single map. Using Map Viewer Classic informational popup windows were
      formatted for features in the map, display settings were adjusted including limiting visibility at
      different zoom levels, and features were styled in a way to enhance user experience. This is also
      where initial map extent was set and legend elements were formatted.
    </p>
    <p>Once the map was composed using Map Viewer Classic, it was added to an ArcGIS Web AppBuilder
      instance. This software allows for development of the interface that surrounds the map data
      using a graphical interface. Though no coding is necessary to use this product, there are
      opportunities to further customize elements within it using web development languages (Hyper
      Text Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, and Javascript).  In this stage of development
      various elements in the interface were added and formatted, including the layer list, legend,
      informational panel, basemap gallery, as well as navigational tools.
    </p>
    <p>Throughout the development process, supplemental information intended for the interface and map
      elements were translated to colloquial Costa Rican Spanish. This was necessary to ensure the
      resulting product would be understood by the primary audience at this stage of the project.
      Though the product is intended to eventually be accessible to a wider audience of non-Spanish
      language speakers, this initial development values local community engagement more highly than
      global accessibility. A number of community members contributed to the translations that have
      been used in the present version of the Atlas.

  <!-- Basemap Design -->
  <div>
    <h2>Basemap Design</h2>
    <p>Due to the focused nature of this web map, a custom basemap was necessary to minimize distraction
      from the map’s intended content and maximize relevant ancillary content. This basemap was developed
      using Mapbox Studio. This web-based software comes readily available with basemap templates and a
      wealth of global data layers including points of interest, terrain models, road lines, building
      footprints, administrative boundaries, land cover and use types, and satellite imagery. Using the
      graphical interface each of these layers display and style properties can be customized as well as
      adding or removing layers. In this way, a number of adjustments were made to the existing “Outdoors”
      basemap template to produce the custom basemap currently on display in the atlas.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Points of Interest:</b> In order to avoid conflict with points of interest submitted by
        community members the existing layer depicting points of interest.
      </li>
      <li><b>Topographic Contour lines:</b> The intervals between topographic contour lines were reduced
        to increase visibility in Costa Rica’s limited altitudinal variation.
      </li>
      <li><b>Country Mask:</b> To focus attention on the area of interest, a semi-opaque mask was added
        to all countries other than Costa Rica.
      </li>
      <li><b>National Protected Areas:</b> The existing layer of protected areas was removed and replaced
        with a modified version that accounted for recent changes reported by
        <a href=”http://www.sinac.go.cr/EN-US/conozca/Pages/default.aspx”>SINAC (National System of Conservation Areas)</a>
      </li>
      <li><b>Reforestation Areas:</b> Areas currently under private conservation and reforestation within
        the region of El Sendero Pacifico was developed from WTN data layers and added to the basemap.
      </li>
      <li><b>Municipalities:</b> With the intention of focusing attention on municipalities related to the
        trails displayed, the existing layer of municipal areas was removed. Points of municipalities were
        added to the map in ArcGIS instead of via the basemap in Mapbox Studio.
      </li>
      <li><b>Trails:</b> Though the basemap template contains a very detailed layer of trails and paths, many
        of which are depicted in the Atlas, they are not required for the purposes of our basemap. The
        existing trails layer was removed from the basemap.
