# El-Sendero-Pacifico
The Atlas de Senderos is being developed as a navigational resource for recreational activities on Costa Rica's network of hiking trails as well as a means of supporting local economies that stand to benefit from traffic along these trail networks. The project was initiated in 2020 by the the <a href = “https://wtn-americas.org/”>World Trails Network Hub for the Americas</a>, with the support of Clark University student, <a href=”andrewhostetler.weebly.com”>Andrew Hostetler</a>. Initially conceived as a resource for a single trail network, El Sendero Pacifico, the Atlas is continuing to branch out to include the rich network of trails around Costa Rica.

In order to support local communities most effectively, the project will coordinate closely with local ambassadors who have intimate knowledge of the trails and their communities. This approach is intended to produce a resource that empowers these community members to form the recreational experience along the trail as they see fit. Community members are involved in the project development in a number of ways:
offering input on project design,
contributing to data collection for the project,
providing media for display in the project,
connecting local businesses with the project.

This project has grown a great deal from its initial concept and will likely continue to as it progresses. The project developers are excited to hear any new ideas, suggestions, or feedback if you have it to share.

## Project Goals
- Provide a navigational resource for people traveling the trail networks.
- Support local economies along and adjacent to trail networks.
- Collaborate with local community members to develop an accurate and desired depiction of trail networks and amenities.
- Develop a plan to maintain the resource for long term use and relevancy.
